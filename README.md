# Labkit

An advanced Fiji plugin for image segmentation. Tutorials, installation instructions and documentation can be found on https://imagej.net/plugins/labkit.

## Software Developement

If you developed a segmentation algorithm, but you don't want to develope your own UI. You might just use the Labkit UI, see this example:
